Exercise 1: Setting Up a Simple Web Page

Interns should create a basic HTML/CSS web page with the following components:

Header with a title and navigation menu.
A main content area with some text.
A footer with contact information.
Exercise 2: Creating a Python Web Server

Interns should create a Python web server using a framework of their choice (e.g., Flask, Django). The server should:

Serve the HTML/CSS page created in Exercise 1.
Handle a GET request and respond with the page.
Include appropriate routing.
Exercise 3: Adding Dynamic Content

Interns should enhance the web page created on Exercise 1 by adding dynamic content. This should involve:

Creating a Python function or route that generates dynamic content (e.g., date/time, random quotes, weather information).
Incorporating this dynamic content into the web page using templating (if applicable to the chosen framework).
Exercise 4: Form Handling

Interns should create a form on the web page to collect user data. This exercise should involve:

Adding a form with input fields for user details (e.g., name, email).
Creating a Python route to handle form submissions and display the submitted data.
Exercise 5: Data Persistence

Interns should enhance the form handling from Exercise 4 by incorporating data persistence. This may involve:

Storing form submissions in a database or a file.
Creating a Python route to retrieve and display the stored data on a separate page.
